# Firefighters Alarm

Firefighters Alarm devoted for volunter firefighters.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

## Motivation

Polish firefighters also known by the acronym OSP are not granted regular income salary. The monetisation
depends on a number of actions they take each month. Then they have an option to either to share the total number among members
or invest the money for the firefighters' unit.

### Objectives

Provide an application for volunteer firefighters in Poland that does not have regular income salary.
Make an alarm system for firefighters that can be invoked by any member of a crew. Alarm system then
will warn the members of a group by going off a ringtone that can be either accepted or declined, depending on the users availability.
